# Guide for coreboot to ASUS P8H61-M LX3 PLUS R2.0
I'm happy to write a guide for first time in my life.

In this tutorial, we'll learn how to replace the motherboard stock firmware with an **open source** firmware.

And I have to say from the beginning of this guide, I'm not responsible for bricked motherboard, burnt rom, thermonuclear war, or you getting fired because of data loss. **All responsibility is YOURS**

## First let's explain what coreboot and EDK2 are,
From [coreboot](https://github.com/coreboot/coreboot/blob/main/README.md):
coreboot is a Free Software project aimed at replacing the proprietary firmware (BIOS/UEFI) found in most computers. coreboot performs the required hardware initialization to configure the system, then passes control to a different executable, referred to in coreboot as the payload. Most often, the primary function of the payload is to boot the operating system (OS).

With the separation of hardware initialization and later boot logic, coreboot is perfect for a wide variety of situations. It can be used for specialized applications that run directly in the firmware, running operating systems from flash, loading custom bootloaders, or implementing firmware standards, like PC BIOS services or UEFI. This flexibility allows coreboot systems to include only the features necessary in the target application, reducing the amount of code and flash space required.

From [Tianocore](https://github.com/tianocore/edk2/blob/master/ReadMe.rst): A modern, feature-rich, cross-platform firmware development environment for the UEFI and PI specifications from www.uefi.org.

# Requirements
- A [CH341A Programmer](https://a.co/d/a06cM4g). (I recommend you to use with [USB Extension Cable](https://a.co/d/ehjoGVo))
- [Chip Puller](https://a.co/d/3fNkbOA) (optional, I removed with 2 small knives (be careful!!))
- An ASUS P8H61-M LX3 PLUS R2.0 motherboard, no dGPU included
- Good level of GNU/Linux knowledge
- Basic hardware knowledge
- Another computer running GNU/Linux distro (btw I'm using Arch)

### What works
- Sound (back and front panel)
- All USB Ports
- Display
- S3 Sleep Mode
- Ethernet
- Windows (don't use that ðŸ˜›)
- Neutralised Intel ME
- UEFI + Secure Boot

### Untested
- PS/2 Input
- PCI-e graphics (actually I can boot successfully into SeaBIOS payload)
- Hibernation
- Serial Port

# Preparing

## Step 1.0: The DIP-8 Thing

 After removing the CMOS battery and power, we'll be comfortable here because our motherboard has a removable socketed BIOS, so that we can easily pull out BIOS and place it in our lovely programmer (look carefully at the small semicircular thing).

 ### 1.1: Backup!

 We need to make a backup in case of any problems (we'll also get some blobs from here)
 
 Firstly, install flashrom on your favorite distro
 ```sh
 # Debian based distros
 sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y flashrom
 
 # Arch based distros
 sudo pacman -Sy flashrom
 ```
 
 Then, we'll have to extract the existing firmware with this
 ```sh
 sudo flashrom --programmer ch341a_spi -r backup.bin
 ```

 (You can do this 2 times to make sure that the hashes of these two backup roms are same)
 ```sh
 sudo flashrom --programmer ch341a_spi -r backup1.bin
 diff backup.bin backup1.bin
```

 If you get a terminal output like this, you have successfully backed up!
 ```sh
 avsar@archlinux ~$ sudo flashrom --programmer ch341a_spi -r backup.bin                                                                                                                                                                     
 [sudo] password for avsar: 
 flashrom v1.2 on Linux 6.8.9-zen1-1.1-zen (x86_64)
 flashrom is free software, get the source code at https://flashrom.org
 
 Using clock_gettime for delay loops (clk_id: 1, resolution: 1ns).
 Found Winbond flash chip "W25Q64.V" (8192 kB, SPI) on ch341a_spi.
 Reading flash... done.
 
 avsar@archlinux ~$
 ```

## Step 2.0: Coreboot time!

 Firstly, we need to install the necessary dependencies for coreboot
  ```sh
  # Debian based distros
  sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y bison build-essential curl flex git gnat libncurses5-dev libssl-dev m4 zlib1g-dev pkg-config nasm imagemagick flashrom
  
  # Arch based distros
  sudo pacman -Sy base-devel gcc-ada flex bison ncurses wget zlib git nasm imagemagick flashrom
  ```

 ### 2.1: Clone coreboot

  ```sh
  git clone https://review.coreboot.org/coreboot
  cd coreboot
  git submodule update --init --checkout
  ```

 ### 2.2 Create a directory for Intel blobs
 
  ```sh
  mkdir -p 3rdparty/blobs/mainboard/asus/h61-series/
  ```

 ### 2.3 Neutralising Intel ME
 
  Here we'll activate the killswitch using the [HAP AltMeDisable](https://github.com/corna/me_cleaner/wiki/HAP-AltMeDisable-bit) bit and delete the ME sections
  ```sh
  cd utils/me_cleaner/
  python me_cleaner.py -S -r -t -d -O out.bin -D descriptor.bin -M me.bin ~/benimki.bin
  ```

  Move these blobs in the folder we created before
  ```sh
  mv descriptor.bin ../../3rdparty/blobs/mainboard/asus/h61-series/
  mv me.bin ../../3rdparty/blobs/mainboard/asus/h61-series/
  ```

 And we're going back
 
  ```sh
  cd ~/coreboot
  ```

 ### 2.4 Configuration
 
  You can choose the options I show here or you can use the defconfig if you are familiar with it
  ```sh
  make menuconfig


  Mainboard â”€>
      Mainboard vendor (ASUS)  --->
      Mainboard model (P8H61-M LX3 R2.0)  --->
      (0x400000) Size of CBFS filesystem in ROM

  Chipset â”€>
      [*] Add Intel descriptor.bin file
       (3rdparty/blobs/mainboard/$(MAINBOARDDIR)/descriptor.bin) Path and filename of the descriptor.bin file
      [*]   Add Intel ME/TXE firmware
       (3rdparty/blobs/mainboard/$(MAINBOARDDIR)/me.bin) Path to management engine firmware

  Device â”€>
      Graphics initialization (None)  --->
      Early (romstage) graphics initialization (None)  --->
      [*] Use onboard VGA as primary video device

  Generic Drivers â”€>
      [*] Support for flash based, SMM mediated data store
      [*]   Use version 2 of SMMSTORE API

  Payload â”€>
      Payload to add (edk2 payload)  --->
        (build/UEFIPAYLOAD.fd) edk2 binary
        EDK II build type (Build UefiPayloadPkg)  --->
        Tianocore's EDK II payload (MrChromebox' edk2 fork)  --->
        (https://github.com/mrchromebox/edk2) URL to git repository for edk2
        (origin/uefipayload_202309) Insert a commit's SHA-1 or a branch name

      [*]   Use Escape key for Boot Manager
      [*]   Use the full screen for the edk2 frontpage
      [*]   Enable UEFI Secure Boot support
      [*]   Add a GOP driver to the Tianocore build
      (IntelGopDriver.efi) GOP driver file
      (-D VARIABLE_SUPPORT=SMMSTORE) edk2 additional custom build parameters
  ```
  Exit and save the config. You can check it by typing `make savedefconfig`.

 ### 2.5 Extract the GOP Driver from Firmware
 
  Remember the backup we made, shown in 1.1? Yep. Now we will get the GOP driver from there so that the display can work.

  Install [UEFITool](https://github.com/LongSoft/UEFITool/releases/download/A68/UEFITool_NE_A68_x64_linux.zip) and open the backup firmware

  ![uefitool-1](https://github.com/lustryrose882/p8h61-m-lx3plus-r2.0-coreboot-guide/blob/main/media/uefitool-1.png)

  Then, press CTRL+F and go to the text tab and type `Intel(R) Gop Driver`

  ![uefitool-2](https://github.com/lustryrose882/p8h61-m-lx3plus-r2.0-coreboot-guide/blob/main/media/uefitool-2.png)

  As you can see, there are 2 inputs here, Ivb and Snb, I choose the Ivb one because my processor is Ivy Bridge

  Then, right click on the PE32 image file, select Extract Body and change the name to IntelGopDriver.efi and move it to the main directory of coreboot

 ### 2.6 Build coreboot
 
  ```sh
   make crossgcc-i386 CPUS=$(nproc)
   make iasl
   make -j$(nproc)
  ```

  You should get an output similar to this after compilation
  ```sh
   FMAP REGION: COREBOOT
   Name                           Offset     Type           Size   Comp

   Built asus/h61-series (P8H61-M LX3 R2.0)
   avsar@archlinux ~/coreboot$             
  ```

## Step 3.0: Flash!

 Now we need to flash the compiled file.
 ```sh
 sudo flashrom --programmer ch341a_spi -w build/coreboot.rom
 ```

 If everything is fine, you should get such an output like
 ```sh
 avsar@archlinux ~/coreboot$ sudo flashrom --programmer ch341a_spi -w build/coreboot.rom
 [sudo] password for avsar:
 flashrom v1.2 on Linux 6.8.9-zen1-1.1-zen (x86_64)
 flashrom is free software, get the source code at https://flashrom.org
 
 Using clock_gettime for delay loops (clk_id: 1, resolution: 1ns).
 Found Winbond flash chip "W25Q64.V" (8192 kB, SPI) on ch341a_spi.
 Reading old flash chip contents... done.
 Erasing and writing flash chip... Erase/write done.
 Verifying flash... VERIFIED.

 avsar@archlinux ~/coreboot$
 ```
 Disconnect the USB connection (definitely do it first), take the chip and insert it into the motherboard as in 1.0.

## Step 4.0: Test time!

 If you saw a nice rabbit logo when the computer booted up, yep everything works. (sorry for the bad quality).

 ![nice rabbit](https://github.com/lustryrose882/p8h61-m-lx3plus-r2.0-coreboot-guide/blob/main/media/20240512_015914.jpg)

 After that you will need to put your favourite bootloader in first boot order and run it.

 ![image1](https://github.com/lustryrose882/p8h61-m-lx3plus-r2.0-coreboot-guide/blob/main/media/20240512_013239.jpg)

 Save and reboot and you will get a nice bootloader screen ðŸ˜¸

 The rest is up to you... and these are my OS screenshots.

 ### And is it over?? IT'S NOT OVER! I'll give you one more little tip.

## Step 2.3.5: BEEP BOOP BOOP BEEP? Speaker TIME!

 Do you miss the opening sound? Yeah, we'll do something similar.
 Go to src/mainboard/asus/h61-series/mainboard.c and add these things and go back to step 2.6
 ```sh

# Last words
 I've been trying to make this tutorial for about 4 hours.

 Actually, I didn't want to do it at first, but my friends asked me to add it, so I did some work and prepared a nice guide.

 Thank you to the whole coreboot team, Corna for the me_cleaner project and MrChromebox for his help and his excellent edk2 project.
